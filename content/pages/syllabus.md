Course Requirements

Because this course is based on class-discussions, participation in all 14 classes is mandatory. If an emergency arises and you must miss a class, make-up work will be arranged in the form of an out-of-class writing assignment.

Two papers from the primary research literature will be discussed in each class period. You must read these in advance of class, and participation in discussion is mandatory.

Grading

There are no formal exams. The class has a pass/fail grading system.

Assignments

Two written assignments will be required.
